# Introduction
In this section we will learn more about interfaces, inversion of control and dependency injection.

## Intefaces
An interface contains definitions for a group of related functionalities that a non-abstract class or a struct must implement.
An interface is like a contract. In the human world, the contract between the two or more humans binds them to act as per the contract. 
In the same way, the interface includes the declaration of one or more functionalities. 
Entities that implement the interface must define functionalities declared in the interface. 
In C#, a class or a struct can implement one or more interfaces.

```csharp
interface IEquatable<T>
{
    bool Equals(T obj);
}

public class Car : IEquatable<Car>
{
    public string Make {get; set;}
    public string Model { get; set; }
    public string Year { get; set; }

    // Implementation of IEquatable<T> interface
    public bool Equals(Car car)
    {
        return this.Make == car.Make &&
               this.Model == car.Model &&
               this.Year == car.Year;
    }
}
```

An interface is like an abstract base class with only abstract members. Any class or struct that implements the interface must implement all its members.
An interface can't be instantiated directly. Its members are implemented by any class or struct that implements the interface.
Interfaces can contain methods, properties, events, indexers, or any combination of those four member types.
Interfaces contain no implementation of methods.
A class or struct can implement multiple interfaces. A class can inherit a base class and also implement one or more interfaces.

|Abstract Classes|Interfaces|
|:----------------:|:----------------:|
|May contain implementation code|May not contain implementation code|
|A class may inherit from a single base class|A class may implement any number of interfaces|
|Members have access modifiers|Members are automatically public|
|May contain fields, properties, constructors, destructors, methods, events and indexers|May only contain properties, methods, events, and indexers|

## Inteface Segregation Principle

Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

This principle is very much related to the Single Responsibility Principle. 
What it really means is that you should always design your abstractions in a way that the clients that are using the exposed methods do not get the whole pie instead. 
That also include imposing the clients with the burden of implementing methods that they don’t actually need.

```csharp
public interface IVehicle
{
    void Drive();
    void Fly();
}
```
```csharp
public class MultiFunctionalCar : IVehicle
{
    public void Drive()
    {
        //actions to start driving car
        Console.WriteLine("Drive a multifunctional car");
    }
 
    public void Fly()
    {
        //actions to start flying
        Console.WriteLine("Fly a multifunctional car");
    }
}
```
```csharp
public class Car : IVehicle
{
    public void Drive()
    {
        //actions to drive a car
        Console.WriteLine("Driving a car");
    }
 
    public void Fly()
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
  
```
```csharp
public class Airplane : IVehicle
{
    public void Drive()
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
 
    public void Fly()
    {
        //actions to fly a plane
        Console.WriteLine("Flying a plane");
    }
}
```
SOLUTION:
```csharp
public interface ICar
{
    void Drive();
}
```
```csharp
public interface IAirplane
{
    void Fly();
}
```

```csharp
public class Car : ICar
{
    public void Drive()
    {
        //actions to drive a car
        Console.WriteLine("Driving a car");
    }
}
```
```csharp
public class Airplane : IAirplane
{
    public void Fly()
    {
        //actions to fly a plane
        Console.WriteLine("Flying a plane");
    }
}
```
```csharp
public class MultiFunctionalCar : ICar, IAirplane
{
    public void Drive()
    {
        //actions to start driving car
        Console.WriteLine("Drive a multifunctional car");
    }
 
    public void Fly()
    {
        //actions to start flying
        Console.WriteLine("Fly a multifunctional car");
    }
}
```
```csharp
public interface IMultiFunctionalVehicle : ICar, IAirplane
{
}
```
```csharp
public class MultiFunctionalCar : IMultiFunctionalVehicle
{
    public void Drive()
    {
        //actions to start driving car
        Console.WriteLine("Drive a multifunctional car");
    }
 
    public void Fly()
    {
        //actions to start flying
        Console.WriteLine("Fly a multifunctional car");
    }
}
```

We can see from the example above, that smaller interface is a lot easier to implement due to not having to implement methods that our class doesn’t need.
Another benefit is that the Interface Segregation Principle increases the readability and maintainability of our code. 
We are reducing our class implementation only to required actions without any additional or unnecessary code.

To sum this article up, we should put an effort into creating smaller interfaces while developing our project. 
Yes, we may end up with a lot of different interfaces in the end but from our point of view, this is much better 
than having a few large interfaces that can force us to implement non-required methods in our classes.

## Inversion of Control 

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle (although, some people refer to it as a pattern). As the name suggests, it is used to 
invert different kinds of controls in object-oriented design to achieve loose coupling. Here, controls refer to any additional responsibilities a
class has, other than its main responsibility.  This include control over the flow of an application, and control over the flow of an 
object creation or dependent object creation and binding.
IoC is all about inverting the control.

```csharp
public class A
{
    B b;

    public A()
    {
        b = new B();
    }

    public void Task1() {
        // do something here..
        b.SomeMethod();
        // do something here..
    }

}

public class B {

    public void SomeMethod() { 
        //doing something..
    }
}
```
In the above example, class A calls b.SomeMethod() to complete its task1. 
Class A cannot complete its task without class B and so you can say that "Class A is dependent on class B" or "class B is a dependency of class A".

```csharp
public class A
{
    B b;

    public A()
    {
        b = Factory.GetObjectOfB ();
    }

    public void Task1() {
        // do something here..
        b.SomeMethod();
        // do something here..
    }
}

public class Factory
{
    public static B GetObjectOfB() 
    {
        return new B();
    }
}
```
As you can see above, class A uses Factory class to get an object of class B. Thus, we have inverted the dependent object creation from class A to Factory. 
Class A no longer creates an object of class B, instead it uses the factory class to get the object of class B.
In an object-oriented design, classes should be designed in a loosely coupled way. Loosely coupled means changes in one class should not force other classes to change, 
so the whole application can become maintainable and extensible. 
Let's understand this by using typical n-tier architecture as depicted by the following figure:
![a](images/demo-architecture.png)
```csharp
public class CustomerBusinessLogic
{
    DataAccess _dataAccess;

    public CustomerBusinessLogic()
    {
        _dataAccess = new DataAccess();
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id)
    {
        return _dataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
}

public class DataAccess
{
    public DataAccess()
    {
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id) {
        return "Dummy Customer Name"; // get it from DB in real app
    }
}
```
Problems in the above example classes:

1. `CustomerBusinessLogic` and `DataAccess` classes are tightly coupled classes. So, changes in the DataAccess class will lead to changes in the `CustomerBusinessLogi`c class. For example, if we add, remove or rename any method in the `DataAccess` class then we need to change the `CustomerBusinessLogic` class accordingly.
2. Suppose the customer data comes from different databases or web services and, in the future, we may need to create different classes, so this will lead to changes in the `CustomerBusinessLogic` class.
3. The `CustomerBusinessLogic` class creates an object of the `DataAccess` class using the new keyword. There may be multiple classes which use the `DataAccess` class and create its objects. So, if you change the name of the class, then you need to find all the places in your source code where you created objects of `DataAccess` and make the changes throughout the code. This is repetitive code for creating objects of the same class and maintaining their dependencies.
4. Because the `CustomerBusinessLogic` class creates an object of the concrete `DataAccess` class, it cannot be tested independently (TDD). The `DataAccess` class cannot be replaced with a mock class.

IoC is a principle, not a pattern!

###### Solution

Let's use the Factory pattern to implement IoC in the above example, as the first step towards attaining loosely coupled classes.

```csharp
public class DataAccessFactory
{
    public static DataAccess GetDataAccessObj() 
    {
        return new DataAccess();
    }
}
```
```csharp
public class CustomerBusinessLogic
{

    public CustomerBusinessLogic()
    {
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id)
    {
        DataAccess _dataAccess =  DataAccessFactory.GetDataAccessObj();

        return _dataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
}
```

## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC. It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class through different ways. Using DI, we move the creation and binding of the dependent objects outside of the class that depends on them.

#### Types of Dependency Injection

**Constructor Injection:** In the constructor injection, the injector supplies the service (dependency) through the client class constructor.

**Property Injection:** In the property injection (aka the Setter Injection), the injector supplies the dependency through a public property of the client class.

**Method Injection:** In this type of injection, the client class implements an interface which declares the method(s) to supply the dependency and the injector uses this interface to supply the dependency to the client class.

#### Constructor Injection

When we provide the dependency through the constructor, this is called a constructor injection.

```csharp
public class CustomerBusinessLogic
{
    ICustomerDataAccess _dataAccess;

    public CustomerBusinessLogic(ICustomerDataAccess custDataAccess)
    {
        _dataAccess = custDataAccess;
    }

    public CustomerBusinessLogic()
    {
        _dataAccess = new CustomerDataAccess();
    }

    public string ProcessCustomerData(int id)
    {
        return _dataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
}

public interface ICustomerDataAccess
{
    string GetCustomerData(int id);
}

public class CustomerDataAccess: ICustomerDataAccess
{
    public CustomerDataAccess()
    {
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id) 
    {
        //get the customer name from the db in real application        
        return "Dummy Customer Name"; 
    }
}
```
As you can see in the above example, the `CustomerService` class creates and injects the `CustomerDataAccess` object into the `CustomerBusinessLogic` class. Thus, the `CustomerBusinessLogic` class doesn't need to create an object of `CustomerDataAccess` using the new keyword or using factory class. The calling class (`CustomerService`) creates and sets the appropriate `DataAccess` class to the `CustomerBusinessLogic` class. In this way, the `CustomerBusinessLogic` and `CustomerDataAccess` classes become "more" loosely coupled classes.

#### Property Injection

The dependency is provided through a public property.
```csharp
public class CustomerBusinessLogic
{
    public CustomerBusinessLogic()
    {
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id)
    {
        return DataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);
    }

    public ICustomerDataAccess DataAccess { get; set; }
}

public class CustomerService
{
    CustomerBusinessLogic _customerBL;

    public CustomerService()
    {
        _customerBL = new CustomerBusinessLogic();
        _customerBL.DataAccess = new CustomerDataAccess();
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id) {
        return _customerBL.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
}
```
As you can see above, the `CustomerBusinessLogic` class includes the public property named `DataAccess`, where you can set an instance of a class that implements `ICustomerDataAccess`. So, `CustomerService` class creates and sets `CustomerDataAccess` class using this public property.

#### Method Injection

In the method injection, dependencies are provided through methods. This method can be a class method or an interface method.
```csharp
interface IDataAccessDependency
{
    void SetDependency(ICustomerDataAccess customerDataAccess);
}

public class CustomerBusinessLogic : IDataAccessDependency
{
    ICustomerDataAccess _dataAccess;

    public CustomerBusinessLogic()
    {
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id)
    {
        return _dataAccess.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
        
    public void SetDependency(ICustomerDataAccess customerDataAccess)
    {
        _dataAccess = customerDataAccess;
    }
}

public class CustomerService
{
    CustomerBusinessLogic _customerBL;

    public CustomerService()
    {
        _customerBL = new CustomerBusinessLogic();
        ((IDataAccessDependency)_customerBL).SetDependency(new CustomerDataAccess());
    }

    public string GetCustomerName(int id) {
        return _customerBL.GetCustomerName(id);
    }
}
```
In the above example, the `CustomerBusinessLogic` class implements the `IDataAccessDependency` interface, which includes the `SetDependency()` mehtod. So, the injector class (`CustomerService`) will now use this method to inject the dependent class (`CustomerDataAccess`) to the client class.

Thus, you can use DI and strategy pattern to create loose coupled classes.
