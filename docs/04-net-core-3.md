## Introduction to .NET Core

.NET Core is an open-source, general-purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft and the .NET community on GitHub. It's cross-platform (supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux) and can be used to build device, cloud, and IoT applications. 

.NET Core has the following characteristics:
- Cross-platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
- Consistent across architectures: Runs your code with the same behavior on multiple architectures, including x64, x86, and ARM.
- Command-line tools: Includes easy-to-use command-line tools that can be used for local development and in continuous-integration scenarios.
- Flexible deployment: Can be included in your app or installed side-by-side (user-wide or system-wide installations). Can be used with Docker containers.
- Compatible: .NET Core is compatible with .NET Framework, Xamarin, and Mono, via .NET Standard.
- Open source: The .NET Core platform is open source, using MIT and Apache 2 licenses. .NET Core is a .NET Foundation project.
- Supported by Microsoft: .NET Core is supported by Microsoft, per .NET Core Support.

NET Core Platform contains the following main parts:
- **.NET Runtime** − It provides a type system, assembly loading, a garbage collector, native interop and other basic services.
- **Fundamental Libraries** − A set of framework libraries, which provide primitive data types, app composition types and fundamental utilities.
- **SDK & Compiler** − A set of SDK tools and language compilers that enable the base developer experience, available in the .NET Core SDK.
- **‘dotnet’ app host** − It is used to launch .NET Core apps. It selects the runtime and hosts the runtime, provides an assembly loading policy and launches the app. The same host is also used to launch SDK tools in much the same way.

There are some key aspects that you can decipher from the architecture. The runtimes shown in Figure 2 will be serving the following purposes:
- **CoreCLR** is the runtime that is optimized for multi-platform and cloud base deployments. You will be using this when you are building applications on ASP.NET Core.
- **.NET Native** (also referred as MRT – Managed Runtime – at times) is the CLR for Universal Apps and is optimized to run on any device and platform natively, which runs Windows. This will follow AOT (ahead of time) compilation instead of erstwhile JIT compilation, and will be targeted for specific platforms say Linux-64 bit and so on. This will ensure a better runtime performance.
- **Unified BCL (Base Class Library)** consists of the basic/fundamental classes that are a part of .NET Core. This also is called as CoreFX. .NET Core follows the NuGet model for delivery of packages for BCL.

## Introduction to ASP.NET Core

- Ability to develop and run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Open-source and community-focused.
- Integration of modern, client-side frameworks and development workflows.
- Support for hosting Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services using gRPC.
- A cloud-ready, environment-based configuration system.
- Built-in dependency injection.
- A lightweight, high-performance, and modular HTTP request pipeline.

#### Web App

###### Razor Pages

Razor Pages can make coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive than using controllers and views.

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddRazorPages(); // This line!
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        else
        {
            app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
            app.UseHsts();
        }

        app.UseHttpsRedirection();
        app.UseStaticFiles();

        app.UseRouting();

        app.UseAuthorization();

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapRazorPages();
        });
    }
}
```

```html
@page
@model RazorPagesContacts.Pages.Customers.CreateModel
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers

<p>Enter a customer name:</p>

<form method="post">
    Name:
    <input asp-for="Customer.Name" />
    <input type="submit" />
</form>
```

###### MVC 

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an application into three main groups of components: Models, Views, and Controllers. This pattern helps to achieve separation of concerns. Using this pattern, user requests are routed to a Controller which is responsible for working with the Model to perform user actions and/or retrieve results of queries. The Controller chooses the View to display to the user, and provides it with any Model data it requires.

![mvc](images/mvc.png)

**The Model** in an MVC application represents the state of the application and any business logic or operations that should be performed by it. Business logic should be encapsulated in the model, along with any implementation logic for persisting the state of the application. Strongly-typed views typically use ViewModel types designed to contain the data to display on that view. The controller creates and populates these ViewModel instances from the model.

**Views** are responsible for presenting content through the user interface. They use the Razor view engine to embed .NET code in HTML markup. There should be minimal logic within views, and any logic in them should relate to presenting content. If you find the need to perform a great deal of logic in view files in order to display data from a complex model, consider using a View Component, ViewModel, or view template to simplify the view.

**Controllers** are the components that handle user interaction, work with the model, and ultimately select a view to render. In an MVC application, the view only displays information; the controller handles and responds to user input and interaction. In the MVC pattern, the controller is the initial entry point, and is responsible for selecting which model types to work with and which view to render (hence its name - it controls how the app responds to a given request).

The **ASP.NET Core MVC** framework is a lightweight, open source, highly testable presentation framework optimized for use with ASP.NET Core.

ASP.NET Core MVC provides a patterns-based way to build dynamic websites that enables a clean separation of concerns. It gives you full control over markup, supports TDD-friendly development and uses the latest web standards.

ASP.NET Core MVC includes the following:
- Routing
- Model binding
- Model validation
- Dependency injection
- Filters
- Areas
- Web APIs
- Testability
- Razor view engine
- Strongly typed views
- Tag Helpers
- View Components

###### Blazor

Blazor is a framework for building interactive client-side web UI with .NET:

- Create rich interactive UIs using C# instead of JavaScript.
- Share server-side and client-side app logic written in .NET.
- Render the UI as HTML and CSS for wide browser support, including mobile browsers.

Using .NET for client-side web development offers the following advantages:
- Write code in C# instead of JavaScript.
- Leverage the existing .NET ecosystem of .NET libraries.
- Share app logic across server and client.
- Benefit from .NET's performance, reliability, and security.
- Stay productive with Visual Studio on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Build on a common set of languages, frameworks, and tools that are stable, feature-rich, and easy to use.

```csharp
<div>
    <h1>@Title</h1>

    @ChildContent

    <button @onclick="OnYes">Yes!</button>
</div>

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public string Title { get; set; }

    [Parameter]
    public RenderFragment ChildContent { get; set; }

    private void OnYes()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Write to the console in C#! 'Yes' button was selected.");
    }
}
```

#### Web API

ASP.NET Core supports creating RESTful services, also known as web APIs, using C#. To handle requests, a web API uses controllers. Controllers in a web API are classes that derive from `ControllerBase`. This article shows how to use controllers for handling web API requests.
